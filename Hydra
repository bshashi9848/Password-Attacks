Step-by-Step Guide
1
Identify the service to attack (SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc.)
2
Prepare your wordlist (rockyou.txt is common)
3
Identify username(s) to test
4
Run Hydra with appropriate options
5
Wait for results - successful logins shown in green
6
Stop attack if valid credentials found
7
Document findings for your report
Understanding the Output
Hydra shows each attempt with [DATA] and successful logins with [PORT][SERVICE] host: IP login: USER password: PASS. A successful crack is highlighted and clearly marked.

Important Warnings
•
Password attacks without permission are ILLEGAL
•
Most systems have account lockout - you may lock out legitimate users
•
Attacks are logged and can be traced back to you
•
Only use on systems you own or have written permission to test
•
Many organizations consider this a serious security incident
⚠️ Use Kali Linux tools only on systems you own or have written permission to test. Unauthorized hacking is illegal and can result in criminal charges.
