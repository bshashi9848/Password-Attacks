Hashcat
Advanced GPU-based password recovery tool

Password Attacks
Description
Hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, supporting five unique modes of attack for over 300 highly optimized hashing algorithms. It leverages GPU power for incredible speed.

Installation / Check
Check if installed:

which hashcat
Install command:

sudo apt install hashcat
Basic Syntax
hashcat -m <hash_type> -a <attack_mode> <hash_file> [wordlist]
Common Commands
Command	What it does	When to use	Risk
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt

MD5 dictionary attack	Cracking MD5 hashes with wordlist	
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt

NTLM hash cracking	Cracking Windows password hashes	
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hashes.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a

Brute force attack	When wordlist fails, try all combinations	
hashcat -m 2500 -a 0 capture.hccapx wordlist.txt

WPA/WPA2 cracking	Cracking WiFi handshake captures	
hashcat --show hashes.txt

Show cracked passwords	View previously cracked hashes	
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule

Dictionary with rules	More effective wordlist attack	
Step-by-Step Guide
1
Identify hash type (use hash-identifier if needed)
2
Find corresponding hashcat mode number (-m)
3
Prepare hash file (one hash per line)
4
Choose attack mode and wordlist
5
Run hashcat and monitor progress
6
Use --show to see cracked passwords
Understanding the Output
Output shows cracking speed, progress percentage, and cracked passwords in format hash:password. Status shows estimated time remaining.

Important Warnings
•
Only crack hashes you have permission to crack
•
GPU-intensive - monitor temperatures
•
Requires good wordlists and rules for effectiveness
⚠️ Use Kali Linux tools only on systems you own or have written permission to test. Unauthorized hacking is illegal and can result in criminal charges.
